# Python-with-OpenCV-and-Computer-Vision-for-Deep-Learning
Udemy Coursework from Python with OpenCV and Computer Vision for Deep Learning taught by Jose Portilla

Here lies my coursework from Udemy, where I learned basics of numpy and image representation using numpy arrays, image basics with OpenCV, image processing techniques, how to connect Jupyter to my webcam, how to detect objects within an image, tracking an object within a video, in addition to training a neural network to more accurately classify images and a capstone project to detect hand movement.

What is deep learning? Deep learning is applied to machine learning, where we use a deep neural network with many neurons as our machine learning algorithm (vs. SVM, KNN Clusters, recommender systems, etc.) We still work with the machine learning principles such as analysis of our machine learning model with confusion matrix and classification report. If we want a more accurate neural network, we need to play around with more neurons, activation function, and possibly running more epochs. After doing so, we can observe classification report and confusion matrix to make more optimal decisions and create a better model for predictions and classification. 

This project was used to prepare me for digital pathology. I have a better preparation to handle classifying images to better detect cancer/no cancer based off image segmentation of nucleus within tissue (from a biopsy). My next step is to learn this using MATLAB.
